A mod that adds more setting options when creating new saves in Captain of Industry.

This mod is active all the time regardless if you enable it in the Mods screen or not. You DON'T actually have to include the mod for saves with custom settings - the selected settings are saved in the savefile and will work without the mod, but if you wanna change the difficulty options in game, you may need to keep it enabled.

Due to how the mod is made, expect it to break with game updates, I will try to fix it when possible if it breaks.
Remember that things may break if you select the super high options
