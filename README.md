A jank mod that adds more setting options when creating new saves in Captain of Industry.

Due to mods not being loaded in the main menu, at first when you launch the game the new options will not appear. You are going to need to create a dummy save with the mod. Upon trying to load the mod for the first time, an error message will appear - this is intentional so it boots you back to the main menu and lets you use the new options! The options will show up until the next game restart where you have to re-do the procedure
What i would recommend doing if you want to use this mod, is create a "dummy save" with the mod in it so that when you run the game you can simply load the save to initiate the mod

**NOTE:** you DON'T actually have to include the mod for saves with custom settings - the selected settings are saved in the savefile and will work without the mod!

Like i said, the mod is jank due to what i mentioned above and the way that the settings are updated in the code. Expect the mod to break with game updates, I will try to fix it when possible if it breaks.
And remember, things may break when you set the value too high/low, especially with cliff/resource height settings!
